# 3DControllerModels
Repository of 3D controller models used as overlays in the [Handheld Companion](https://github.com/Valkirie/HandheldCompanion) application.

The designs are either done from scratch or from various free sources on the internet.

Please note that none of the models are made to be dimensionally correct.
