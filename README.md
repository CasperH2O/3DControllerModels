# 3DControllerModels
Repository of 3D controller models used as overlays in the [Handheld Companion](https://github.com/Valkirie/HandheldCompanion) application.

The designs are either done from scratch or from various free sources on the internet.

Please note that none of the models are made to be dimensionally correct.

## How to, contribution guidelines

Want to add a 3D model here? Great!
Z Up, either the model is modelled with Z up or the export is done in such a way.
Naming convention of the various parts have changed over time due to changes in Handheld Companions controller button naming schemes.

### Fusion 360

Build up of model is done in such a way that it can be exported in seperate .obj files using export as mesh function.

### Blender

Exported using a bulk python tool found on [Stack Exchange](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/5382/export-multiple-objects-to-obj).
